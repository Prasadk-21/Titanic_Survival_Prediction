# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project uses logistic regression to predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on features such as age, sex, class, and fare. The model is trained to classify whether a passenger survived or not.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset used for this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It includes information such as:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- **Name**: Passengerâ€™s name
- **Sex**: Gender
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Fare paid
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

## Results
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of **80.75%** on the test dataset. Further improvements can be made by exploring different features or machine learning algorithms.

## Source
